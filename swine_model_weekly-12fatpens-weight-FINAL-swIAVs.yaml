# NAME OF THE MODEL

# DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL
model_info:
  abstract: 'This model is a simple discrete-time, stochastic,
  compartmental SEIR model of a swine population with different 
  life stages (i.e., gestation to finishing), sex, and age structure, 
  at the metapopulation scale where the finishing group is composed 
  of 12 pens.'

# DESCRIPTION OF GROUPINGS, ASSOCIATED WITH PROCESSES WHICH ARE NOT
# DIRECTLY BASED ON STATE MACHINES
# A grouping is based on one or more variables. For instance, the
# grouping for managing the 'infection' process is based on the
# variable 'health_state' (coming from the state machine with the same
# name): hence, one group will be defined for all possible values of
# the health_state variable.

grouping:
  herd:
    infection_by_sex: [health_state, sex]
    infection_by_age: [health_state, age_group]
    sex_and_age: [sex, age_group]
    parities: [parity]
